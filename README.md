### My own badly implemented dependency injection for php projects
based on [this tutorial](https://matthewdaly.co.uk/blog/2019/02/02/creating-your-own-dependency-injection-container-in-php/)

### TODO:

- [x] Create container
    - [x] Create the necessary exceptions.
    - [x] Create the necessary container.
- [ ] Implement Definitions File (set classes using a php array file)
- [ ] Use this container in some projects to see if it works.
